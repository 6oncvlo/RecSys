# RecSys v1

Explore multiple recommender system algotithms on MovieLens ml-100k dataset.
Essentially, there are three notebooks
- **main_train**, model testing phase, i.e., it tests multiple algorithms and performs hyper-parameter tunning through config_train.yml
- **main_evaluate**, model evaluation phase, i.e., it analyzes the performance of the best chosen methodology
- **main_inference**, model building phase, i.e., it creates movie recommendations for all users

For a summary of the developed work, feel free to check the **deck.pdf** file.
